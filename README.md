# learning-react

## Introduction

This repository contains code that I wrote as I was learning the *React language*.  I've pushed code as I was learning the language via a course, and does not reflect my coding pattern i.e. I am a big proponent of writing tests as you go.  However, in this case, the tests will be/were written when I approached the testing chapter.
